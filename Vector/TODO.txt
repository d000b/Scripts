ADD MultidimensionalVector
COMMENT At the current time (02/16/2021) the problem is that the function cannot return 2 types, and there is no desire to build a template based Vector<Vector<Vector<float>>>
COMMENT The Main problem of this method, in the line above, is the impossibility of dynamic initialization of the shopping mall, the dimension will always remain static


I thought about it and decided that it is necessary to add memory optimization as in std :: string, where the memory address cell is used as a container for letters.
