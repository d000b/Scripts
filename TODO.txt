To ADD:
	TriangularMatrix (Simmetric 2D Matrix (the other, lower symmetrical upper half of the table is simply deleted and is not written to memory))
	BasicDestructor
	CircularVector
	Filter Bloom's

To FIX:
	CircularVector -> (I had idea in paper sheet, but i can't return iterator)
	String -> allocated == length + 1(null terminated symbol)
	LinesReader -> (idk)
